## best practice:
The border-box value makes the element's total width and height include padding and border. Using box-sizing: border-box can be particularly useful for creating consistent layouts and avoiding unexpected sizing issues when adding padding and borders to elements.

transition: property duration timing-function delay; opacity is the CSS property being transitioned.
0.5s is the duration of the transition (in seconds).
ease is the timing function.
0s is the delay before the transition starts (in seconds).
The ease timing function creates an effect where the transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then slows down again toward the end. It gives a smooth and natural feel to the transition.
Other predefined timing functions in CSS include:
linear: The transition occurs at a constant speed from start to finish.
ease-in: The transition starts slowly and accelerates toward the end.
ease-out: The transition starts quickly and slows down toward the end.
ease-in-out: The transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and slows down toward the end.
